I am a researcher working on AI for mathematics and reasoning with a focus on improving theorem proving capabilities of LLMs.
I've created [MathArena](https://matharena.ai/), a benchmark which evaluates LLMs on latest math competitions which is now used by leading labs such as [Google DeepMind](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#enhanced-reasoning), [xAI](https://x.ai/news/grok-3) and [Microsoft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21318).


Previously, I received my PhD at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Prof. Martin Vechev](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/people/martin) during which I worked on formal methods for AI safety.
My research has been featured in media outlets such as [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2025/04/08/ai-llms-astonishingly-bad-at-doing-proofs-and-disturbingly-using-blarney-in-their-answers/) and [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-chatbots-can-guess-your-personal-information/).
During high school I won gold medal at IMO and silver medals at IOI.

I also spent some time in industry working on securing AI agents at a startup, and during my internships I worked on ads optimization at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com), spam detection at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and Bayesian Optimization at [SigOpt](https://sigopt.org/).
