I am an AI researcher currently focusing on reasoning, AI agents and AI applications in math.
I've created [MathArena](https://matharena.ai/), a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on latest math competitions which is now used by leading labs such as [Google DeepMind](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#enhanced-reasoning), [xAI](https://x.ai/news/grok-3) and [Microsoft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21318).
Previously, I received my PhD at ETH Zurich during which my work has been featured in media such as [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2025/04/08/ai-llms-astonishingly-bad-at-doing-proofs-and-disturbingly-using-blarney-in-their-answers/) and [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-chatbots-can-guess-your-personal-information/).
During high school I won gold medal at [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=22914) and silver medals at [IOI](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/3039).
I also spent time in industry working on securing AI agents at a startup, and doing internships at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and [SigOpt](https://sigopt.org/).

### Research Interests

My current research interests are the following:

- **AI for mathematics**: Given my experience at [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=22914) and [IOI](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/3039), I am interested in lifting the recent improvements in reasoning to more difficult, proof-based mathematical problems. 
I believe that the right approach starts with reliable evaluation (see [MathArena](https://matharena.ai/)) and leverages both informal chain-of-though reasoning combined
with formal solvers used as tools.

- **AI agents for science**: Beyond mathematics, I am interested in building general agents that can combine informal reasoning with tool usage such as code execution and formal solvers to solve more general science problems.

- **Safe and reliable AI agents**: I am also interested in applying formal methods to guarantee safety of AI agents. I've done some initial work pursuing this idea, which you can find [here](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=c6jNHPksiZ). My earlier work on evaluating AI agent safety has recently won [first prize in SafeBench competition](https://www.mlsafety.org/safebench/winners) (50 000 USD).
